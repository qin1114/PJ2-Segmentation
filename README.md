# PJ2-Segmentation
Segmentation from medical images is an essential prerequi-site in many medical applications, such as localization and quantification of tissues and pathology. However, fully automatic segmentation is still challenging, due to heterogeneous intensity distributions and indistinct boundaries in the images. In this paper, we propose the SCSRN [1] to embed a shape reconstruction neural network(SRNN) and a spatial con-straint neural network(SCNN) into basic U-Net. SRNN aims to maintain a realistic shape of the resulting segmentation through shape constraint from gold labels. It should be pre-trained by a set of on-hot coding transferred from gold standard, and then embedded into loss function as a regulation term. Furthermore, SCNN takes the spatial information into consideration via the multi-task learning strategy. We connect the SC module to the bottom of U-Net to predict 2D spatial index from the encoder information. We train our model on 45 patients [2] [3] and adopt 6-fold cross validation. The results show that the proposed SCSRN outperformed the conventional schemes especially on Hausdorff distance(HD) and average surface distance(ASD).
